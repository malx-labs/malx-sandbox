# MalX Sandbox  
**A controlled environment for malware execution and adversarial experimentation.**

MalX Sandbox provides a safe, isolated space to observe malicious behaviour, test evasion techniques, and study execution flow under real-world conditions.

## Purpose
- Execute payloads and loaders in controlled environments.
- Capture runtime behaviour, side effects, and evasion signals.
- Support adversarial testing workflows and operator experimentation.

## Capabilities (Planned)
- Dynamic execution harness  
- Behavior tracing and instrumentation  
- Evasion testing modules  
- Execution-flow visualization  
- Automated adversarial scenarios  

## Use Cases
- Malware research  
- Red-team tradecraft development  
- Evasion technique validation  
- Execution-flow experimentation  

## Warning
For authorized research environments only. Never use on production systems.
